# postman-testing
This is a testing project, where I was just palying with Postman testing:

Create a postman collection to test the following endpoints: https://petstore.swagger.io/:
-	Add a new pet to the store
-	Update an existing pet using form data
-	Search for a pet
-	Remove a pet from the store
-	Place an order for a pet
-	Get a list of the store inventory 
-	Create a user
-	User login
-	Update user
-	User logout 
-	Delete a user
Assume the endpoints will need to be executed on multiple environments.
